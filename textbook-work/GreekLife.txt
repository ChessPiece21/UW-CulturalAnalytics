What I 👁 think 💭 people 👥 who are not in the Greek System 🚰😎🥶 need 😳 to understand 🤔 is that partying 🥳 isn't just something 😩 we do. It's ingrained into our lives 💓. Many 💯 people 👫, these days 📅, are perfectly 💯 content 🌐 with sitting 💺 on their computers 👩‍💻 all 🙌 day 📆 playing 🎮 video 🎥 games 🎮. I 👥 used ♦ to be a competitive 👑 gamer 🎮 and I 👁 used 💻 to do this. After 👀 joining ☑ the Greek system 📻, partying 🥳 became 🚡 a new 🆕 norm 🚾 that was ingrained into my life 👤. We need 👉 it for our wellbeing. It helps 💁 us 🚶🏻🚶🏼 escape 🚶‍♂️ society 🗺. There have even 💅 been studies 📿⛪ that show 📺 how necessary gatherings 👫👪👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 are for our wellbeing. The fact 🧠 that it was stripped away ↔ from us 🇨🇳, especially 🌟 by something 🙅‍♀️ that barely 🙅🏼‍♂️ affects us 🇨🇳 specifically 🐒 is very 💯 detrimental to our mental 🤯 state 🇺🇸. People 👫 are giving 🎁 us 🇨🇳 so much 😩😂🙀 crap 💩 for it, yet 🎩👓👍 they don't know 🤔 what it's like 👍 for us 🚶🏻🚶🏼 to be deprived of everything 🤔 that's ↗ fun 😃😂 for us 🇨🇳.
