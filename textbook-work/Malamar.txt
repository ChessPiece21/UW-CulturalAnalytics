Wanna know who the best Pokemon obviously is? Malamar. Everything about it is just astounding, its stats, typing, etc. Its typing is very versitile, making it only weak to bug and fairy type. Its stats give it some nice bulk to it, and has astoundingly good Attack! Better yet, Malamar has a unique evolution, you have to hold your 3DS UPSIDE DOWN! YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY, UPSIDE DOWN! That alone is what makes Malamar one of the greatest Pokemon ever. Its design is just plain flawless, so why would you choose any other Pokemon over Malamar? It is based off of a vampire squid, a squid that is known for turning inside, KINDA LIKE HOW MALAMAR EVOLVES! THE REFERENCE TO ITS OWN CREATURE IS JUST AMAZING! Great work Gamefreak, you have made one of the best Pokemon there is to date!
